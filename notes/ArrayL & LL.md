Array List (Dynamic Array) 

- contiguous memory, indexable, amortized append, resizing strategy (e.g., double capacity).

    Operations & complexities:
- Access: O(1)
- Insert at end (amortized): O(1)
- Insert at arbitrary index: O(n)
- Delete at arbitrary index: O(n)
- Resize: O(n) occasionally



Linked List (Singly & Doubly) 

Nodes with pointers; O(1) insert/delete at head; O(n) search; doubly supports reverse traversal.

    Operations & complexities:
- Access by index: O(n)
- Insert at head: O(1)
- Insert after node: O(1)
- Delete node (given pointer): O(1)
