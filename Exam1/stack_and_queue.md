Stack (Array & Linked List) 

LIFO; can be implemented with dynamic array or linked list.

Operations & complexities: push/pop: O(1), peek: O(1)



Queue (Array & Linked List) 

FIFO, implement with circular buffer (array) or linked list.

Operations & complexities: enqueue/dequeue: O(1)


Cursor-Based (CB) List (Array-based linked list) 

Emulate pointers using array indices (useful in low-level C for static memory). Has free-list for unused nodes.

Operations & complexities: similar to linked list but with index manipulation; insert/delete O(1) given position.
